# The objective for this assignment is to write a piece of code that employs the C++ relationships of Need to Know About (NTKA) and A Part Of (APO) relationship. For this program you will be creating a parking spot database.

The parking spot program should be such that it will contain two classes. The two classes will be a car class called cCar, and an employee class called cEmployee. The cCar class will have an APO relationship with the cEmployee Class meaning it will contain a cEmployee object as part of its private data.

In addition to the cEmployee object, the cCar class will contain private data consisting of a record number, a license plate string, car make, car colour and a cost variable. The cost variable will be defined such that any changes to it will affect all cCar objects.

The cEmployee object private data will consist of two things. The employee name and employee department.

Both classes will contain all the Mutator and accessor functions required to access and mutate each piece of data individually
